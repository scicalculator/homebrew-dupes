      We have had many different clang failure reports:
        https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/20
        https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/49
        https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/pull/66
        https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/68
      Unfortunately, nobody seems to be interested in investigating and fixing them.
      If you have any knowledge to share or can provide a fix, please open an issue.
      Thanks!
